# Ryanator
Are you a fan of the HBO sitcom Veep? Do you believe what former Vice President Jonah Ryan claims to believe?
<div/>
If you do, then you're in luck! 
<div/><div/>The Ryanator is a Chrome extension that changes instances of "algebra" to "Al-Jazeera," referencing a joke from the hit sitcom: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=embMAtagQiU
<div/><div/>
I'm definitely going to add more words to this once I figure it out.

# How To Use:
So I presently do not have enough money to upload this to Chrome Developers, but there is a way for you to use this extension on your own Internet if you use Chrome.
<div/><div/>
1. Download this package from Github, and unzip it in the folder of your choice.
2. At the top right of Chrome, click the More (:) tab, go to "More Tools," and then click "Extensions."
3. When you're at the Extensions tab, click "Load Unpacked" and import the unzipped folder (click on it when it tells you which file to use).
4. And you're done!

Have fun, and remember, NO MORE MATH!
